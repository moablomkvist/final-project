# MVP
– A site where the users can post tips on free patterns. 
With link sources to the pattern, what needles and yarn they used for the pattern etc. 
– The posts is saved to a database. Other users can save (favourite-mark)  the patterns that is posted. 
– The user will be able to login and see the patterns. 
– We have a row counter, a simple click count-tool to count how many rows you have knitted. 
The counted rows is saved by local storage.
